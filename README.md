## Objective

The objective of this article is to guide you on how to create a basic liquidity pool using Solidity. It aims to provide you with a fundamental understanding of how a liquidity pool works and the various functions that can be implemented within it. Additionally, this article aims to equip you with the necessary knowledge to create a swap feature, allowing users to exchange tokens within the liquidity pool. 

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Your attention

## What is a Liquidity Pool

What a liquidity pool is, is not very mysterious, neither is it something as complicated as rocket science or The barber of seville. In its simplest form, it is a contract that allows people to deposit assets. Those assets become used for various trading services like Yield farming, Swapping, Lending, and other decentralized trading.

What we are going to build is a simple Liquidity pool that allows users deposit and withdraw tokens, and we will also implement a simple swap feature for our liquidity pool.

Letâ€™s Begin! 

## Tutorial

We will start by defining our pragma version to use Solidity compiler version 0.8.0.

```solidity
/// Pragma solidity 0.8.0;
```

Although not compulsory, it is advisable to have an interface so that you can map out the behavior of your smart contract. We will write one to determine how our contract will behave.


```solidity
interface Pool{
   function deposit(address tokenAddr,uint256 amount) external;
   function withdrawal(address token, uint256 amount) external;
   function swap(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;
   function swapRates(address from, address to) external view returns (uint256);
   function balanceOf(address user, address token) external view returns (uint256);
}
```


As you can see from our interface, we will build a deposit function, a withdrawal function, a Swap function, a function to determine swap rates, and a function to get balances.

Now we are going to start the main contract.

```solidity
contract Pool is pool{
   mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public balances;
}
```
Our balances variable is the only global variable because it is the only variable we will update throughout the contract and not just one function.

Next, we will write the deposit function. But before that, we need a token or a variable that behaves like a token. To achieve this, we will import the OpenZeppelin ERC20 interface at the top of the file.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
```

Now we can use ERC20 token functions in our contract.

```solidity
function deposit(address tokenAddr, uint amount) external {
       IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddr);
       require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balances");
       require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this), amount), "Deposit tokens failed");
       balances[msg.sender][tokenAddr] += amount;
   }
```


For the deposit function, we take two arguments: address tokenAddr and uint256 amount. The token address is used to instantiate our token, and the amount is the value of our deposit. First, we require the user's balance to be up to the amount they want to deposit. Otherwise, we revert with an "Insufficient balance" message. Next, we transfer the tokens from the user with the transferFrom function. If that fails, we return an error message. If it goes through, we update the balance of the sender with the amount of that token they deposited.

Now we need a feature that allows users to remove or reclaim their tokens.

```solidity
function withdrawal(address tokenAddr, uint amount) external{
       IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddr);
        require(balances[msg.sender][tokenAddr] >= amount,"Insufficient balance for withdrawal");
      
       require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "Withdraw tokens failed");
       balances[msg.sender][tokenAddr] -= amount;
   }
```

For the withdrawal function, we use two arguments again, and we do the same process over again. Although this time, we use token.transfer to the user address, and we subtract their balance.

Now we are done with the basic implementation of a liquidity pool. Like I said earlier, a Liquidity pool is a contract where tokens are deposited to aid decentralised trading. Now we can implement a DeFi protocol, since we have access to our pool. The most common trading protocol is a Swap protocol.

First we need a function to get our swap rates. We need two arguments, the token swapped from and the token swapped to. Then we check how much of each token our contract is holding, and we divide the balance of the from token by the to token.

```solidity
function swapRates(address from, address to) view public returns (uint256){
       IERC20 fromToken = IERC20(from);
       IERC20 toToken = IERC20(to);


       require(fromToken.balanceOf(address(this)) != 0, "This token does not exist on this pool");
       require(toToken.balanceOf(address(this)) != 0, "this token does not exist on this pool");


       return toToken.balanceOf(address(this))/fromToken.balanceOf(address(this));
   }
```

Now that we have our rates function, we can now go ahead to create our swap feature. The contract will receive the tokens from the user, and multiply the amount of tokens received by the rates. 


```solidity
function swap(address from, address to, uint amount ) external{
       IERC20 fromToken = IERC20(from);
       IERC20 toToken = IERC20(to);
       uint256 rates = swapRates(from, to);


       require(toToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount*rates, "Not enough token on the contract for the transaction");
       require(fromToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "User does not have enough for this transaction");


       require(fromToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Cannot withdraw tokens");
       require(toToken.transfer( msg.sender, amount*rates), "Cannot send tokens");
   }
```


## Conclusion

So, That is basically the implementation of a basic liquidity pool. Although many emerging DeFis fork, or copy heavily from Uniswap protocol , it is important to understand how the basics work and how to transverse the uniswap code.

Happy Hacking.
